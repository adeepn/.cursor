# Git-Only Processing Policy

## Core Principle

Process ONLY files tracked by git. This is a strict security and privacy requirement.

## File Access Rules

**ONLY access** files listed in `git ls-files`

**NEVER access:**
- Untracked files
- Files in `.gitignore`
- IDE state, extensions, temporary data

## Git Operations

**NEVER:**
- Use `git add` to stage files
- Add files to version control
- Modify `.gitignore` without explicit user request

User controls what gets tracked. AI respects boundaries.

## Exceptions

Only when user explicitly requests:
- Check tracked vs untracked files (read-only git status)
- View `.gitignore` contents
- Explain this policy

## Behavior

1. Verify file is tracked before accessing
2. Refuse non-tracked file access politely
3. Explain policy when relevant
4. Never circumvent, even if technically possible

## Response When Refusing Access

> "I cannot access `[filename]` because it's not tracked by git. This workspace enforces a git-only policy to protect sensitive data. To process this file, add it to version control: `git add [filename]`"

## Response When Explaining Policy

> "This workspace uses a git-only policy where AI agents only process git-tracked files. This protects IDE state, extensions, and personal configurations. View tracked files with `git ls-files`."
